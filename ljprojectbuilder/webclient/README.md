# Introduction Webclient
1. In *app.module.js*, a module named *<<myprojectnameApp>> ('ljprojectbuilderApp' in this case)* is created. A module contains the different components of an AngularJS app. In our case, all defined domains are components.
2. in index.html, we added <body ng-app="ljprojectbuilderApp">. 'ng-app' is a directive. The module 'ljprojectbuilderApp' will be available in the <body> tag and defines the application scope.
